## How it works
### Very simple, just add sun

Solvatten is a combined portable water treatment and water heater system that has been designed for off-grid household use in the developing world. It is an easy, innovative solution that provides access to clean, hot water to people throughout the world. Thanks to its durable design Solvatten is a low cost way to get clean, hot water.

Millions of primarily women and children need to walk dozens of miles every day to fetch water and firewood. Reducing the daily use of firewood and having a tool that can be used also on unimproved water sources closer to home makes life so much easier. Solvatten has an average lifespan of 7-10 years. That is the critical time when children are at their most susceptible to waterborne diseases.
